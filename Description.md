- **Data Gathering:**
  - Used Pandas to read a wine dataset from a CSV file.
  - Explored the dataset with basic commands such as `shape`, `info`, `isna().sum()`, and `describe()` to understand its structure and characteristics.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Checked the shape, info, and summary statistics of the dataset.
  - No missing values were found.
  - Descriptive statistics were examined to understand the distribution of features.
  
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Detected outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
  - Replaced outliers with upper or lower bounds for specific columns using a custom function.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  - Standardized the data using `StandardScaler`.
  - Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality.
  - Computed covariance matrix, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
  - Certainly! Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique w

- **Objective:** Reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining its essential features and minimizing information loss.

- ***Key Concepts:***
  1. **Principal Components (PCs):** Linear combinations of the original features capturing the most significant variance in the data.
  
  2. **Variance:** PCs are ranked by the amount of variance they explain. The first PC explains the most variance, followed by the second, and so on.

  3. **Orthogonality:** PCs are orthogonal to each other, meaning they are uncorrelated.

- **Implementation Steps:**

  1. **Standardization:** Standardize the features to have zero mean and unit variance.

  2. **Covariance Matrix:** Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized features.

  3. **Eigenvalue Decomposition:** Decompose the covariance matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

  4. **Select Principal Components:** Rank the eigenvalues in decreasing order and choose the top k eigenvectors to form the principal components.

  5. **Project Data:** Multiply the original data by the selected eigenvectors to obtain the transformed data in a lower-dimensional space.

  6. **Variance Explained:** Analyze the cumulative variance explained by the selected principal components to determine the retained information.

  7. **Reconstruction (Optional):** If needed, reconstruct the data back to the original space using the selected principal components.

- **Model Training:**
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Applied Logistic Regression for multi-class classification.
  - Utilized PCA for dimensionality reduction.

- **Results and Conclusion:**
  - Explored variance ratios of principal components.
  - Trained a Logistic Regression model on the transformed data.
