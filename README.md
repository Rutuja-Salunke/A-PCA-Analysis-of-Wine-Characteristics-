# "Exploring the Essence of Terroir: A PCA Analysis of Wine Characteristics"

- **Objective:** Explore and analyze a wine dataset to understand its characteristics and patterns.

- **Key Steps:**
  1. **Data Gathering:** Loaded the wine dataset using Pandas and conducted initial exploration.
  
  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Checked dataset statistics and ensured no missing values.
  
  3. **Feature Engineering:** Handled outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
  
  4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Standardized data, applied PCA for dimensionality reduction.
  
  5. **Model Training:** Split the dataset, used Logistic Regression for classification, and incorporated PCA for feature reduction.
  
  6. **Results and Conclusion:** Explored variance ratios and trained a Logistic Regression model on the transformed data.

- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.

This project focuses on understanding and processing the wine dataset, employing techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction, and utilizing Logistic Regression for classification. The code encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model training.
